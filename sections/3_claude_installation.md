## 3. Claude Code Installation

This guide is focused on Claude Code. To use it, you need a Claude.ai account and to install Claude Code on your system.
Follow the official guide <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart#step-1:-install-claude-code>.

**Important**: All code you work with in Claude Code is sent to Anthropic's servers for processing. Before using it on any project, get explicit consent from the project owner or customer, and review [Anthropic's privacy policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy). This applies especially to proprietary code or projects with strict data handling requirements. Do not apply it on the project until the consent is received.

To try out the tool, you'll need to buy at least a Pro Plan subscription costing $20/month.  For regular usage, you'll likely need a Max subscription ($100/month). Claude sets usage limits per 5-hour window—with the Pro plan, I'd hit the limit within 1 hour of active work. The Max plan (5x the capacity) fits my workflow well, and I usually use it close to its limits.

Here is the official Claude documentation <https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/> and the Claude Code documentation <https://code.claude.com/docs/en>. I'll reference specific parts in the subsequent sections.
