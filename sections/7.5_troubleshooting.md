### 7.5 Troubleshooting Common Failures

Here's a short overview of how I handle common failures.

#### Repeated incorrect code

When Claude Code produces incorrect implementations repeatedly, my response depends on the type of failure.

**Immediate fixes:**

- I add `// REVIEW:` comments directly in the source code to point out specific issues
- I type correction notes in the terminal for quick adjustments
- For complete misalignment with my design, I roll back changes, `/clear`, and revise the task description or project documentation before retrying

**Preventing recurrence:**

I use `#` at the start of my input to quickly add a rule to CLAUDE.md (Claude Code appends the message to the nearest CLAUDE.md file), or I add a rule directly — this is my most common fix for recurring issues.

For repeated failures in specific operations, I create a dedicated skill. Example: Claude kept forgetting to apply migrations to the test database and verify that all migrations were applied. A `backend-implementing-migration` skill with step-by-step verification fixed this permanently.

#### Context pollution

When Claude starts exploring wrong modules or mixing up context:

**Recognition:** I monitor what Claude includes in context — it describes its process. When I notice it exploring wrong areas (e.g., modules with similar naming), I `/clear` it immediately rather than trying to correct the course.

**Prevention by design:** The workflow structure prevents most context pollution architecturally:

- Each subtask starts with `/clear`
- Sessions end with commit + implementation overview
- Implementation overviews preserve progress across sessions — when I `/clear` and start fresh, Claude reads the overview instead of needing full conversation history

#### Plan gaps discovered during implementation

Sometimes implementation plan has gaps that only become apparent during coding.

When I spot issues, I add `// REVIEW:` comments directly in the source code or type them to the terminal or update the UML diagram to address the problem. Claude Code reads these comments and changes, then makes the necessary fixes and updates the implementation plan and overview retrospectively. 

#### API hallucinations

Claude may invent non-existent methods or use incorrect API signatures — both for external libraries and my own codebase.

**What catches them:**

- Static code analysis (type checking)
- Unit and integration tests

These run before code review, catching most issues automatically.

**When they slip through:**

- I look up the actual API reference manually
- I provide Claude with links to current documentation
- I ask Claude to read my custom components and study their interfaces before using them
