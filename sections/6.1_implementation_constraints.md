### 6.1 Implementation constraints

This section describes the constraints I follow when working with Claude Code. These guide my decisions about LLM autonomy.

### Having full control over the design decisions

When building a quick prototype, you might not be worried about the quality of the generated source code, and you might give the LLM the opportunity to design and implement solutions on its own, but for a large project, this approach will fail—Claude needs human guidance for design decisions.

So, for medium and large-sized tasks, I'm preparing implementation plans on my own. For small-sized tasks, I'm asking Claude Code to prepare the implementation plan first, and carefully review it before accepting.

### Implementing each task within the Claude Code context window

As covered earlier, context compaction degrades performance. I split tasks to fit within a single context window. This also aligns with CI practices—smaller tasks mean smaller, more focused commits.
