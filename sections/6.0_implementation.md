## 6. Workflows implementation

After understanding the challenges and building blocks, this section shows how I combine them into daily workflows. I'll describe my main workflows and provide specific examples of how I work with tasks.

By workflow, I mean a repeatable process for completing tasks. It includes:

- My actions: reviewing plans, making decisions, providing approvals
- Claude Code commands: initiating tasks, triggering reviews, committing
- Other tools: task tracker integration, code review subagents

Each workflow follows steps: gather context → clarify requirements → prepare implementation plan → review plan by the developer -> implement planned updates → review implementation by Claude Code and developer → commit. Key gates (plan review, code review) ensure I maintain control over the output.
