### 6.2 Repository and project structure

#### 6.2.1 Modular structure

You need to help Claude Code understand the structure of your project so it can efficiently navigate it and find the needed functionality more quickly. 

I recommend using a feature-based structure for your project instead of a flat or component-type-based structure.

Example of feature-based structure:

```
src/
|_projects/
  |_projects/
  |_tasks/
    |_actions/
    |_list/
    |_view/
    |_comments/
      |_actions/
      |_view/
|_notifications/
  |_ ...
```

Example of component-type-based structure:

```
src/
|_hooks/
|_pages/
|_services/
|_types/
|_...
```

A feature-based structure is easier for both humans and programs to understand. And this structure follows the high cohesion principle. A modular structure simplifies the gathering of relevant context for an LLM agent — by reading the project documentation and files from a specific directory, it can get the information about the full feature implementation.

#### 6.2.2 CLAUDE.md files and project documentation

My root level CLAUDE.md has the following structure:

```markdown
## Technical Stack overview

[Just list of used frameworks, main libraries, database, etc]

## Architecture overview

### Feature module structure

[Short description of typical feature-module structure]

### Key Feature modules

[List of key root-level modules with 1-line description]

### Key Patterns

[Statement of key patterns used in the source code with the reference to the document that provides some more information how the pattern is applied in the project (uses progressive disclosure)]

### Guides

[The set of links to documentation documents in the format:
* `See ./filepath.md for ...`
That references the documentation related testing strategy, git commit format, etc. So Claude Code might read these docs if it's needed for the current task.]

### HARD RULES

[The list of unstructured rules that I add to tweak Claude Code behavior (when I notice that it fails consistently with some tasks). Also, you can type `#` to quickly add some rule to this section just from your current conversation.
When this list grows you might revise it and structure it - create separate documents, etc.]
```

I store all project documents in the same repository in the `doc/` directory.

A modular structure also lets you use nested CLAUDE.md files—each level adds relevant context automatically. You might create a CLAUDE.md file on each level, and when Claude Code accesses `src/projects/tasks/comments/actions/UpdateButton.tsx,` it will add to the context files:

* CLAUDE.md
* src/projects/CLAUDE.md
* src/projects/tasks/CLAUDE.md
* src/projects/tasks/comments/actions/CLAUDE.md

And all these files will append to each other by providing highly relevant data to the context. 

Just a note: I do not recommend creating CLAUDE.md for every single module that you have in your project. Start without this module CLAUDE.md file, add it only when you see issues in understanding some implementation. Also, if Claude Code needs to access the directory frequently, you might want to add CLAUDE.md to make it work faster by providing a condensed description of the module implementation. But assume by default that Claude Code should understand the implementation based on your project-level documentation (remember the rule: use the simplest solution that works).

#### 6.2.3 Monorepo setup

Beyond organizing individual modules, the overall repository structure also matters. I found it useful to work with all project components in a monorepo setup. This way you can easily reference backend source code when working on frontend, etc.

Technically, I have different repositories for each component, I've just created a separate repository with a wrapper for all components. The final structure looks like the following:

```
monorepo
|_.claude
|_docs
|_CLAUDE.md
|_backend
  |_docs
  |_CLAUDE.md
  |_...
|_frontend
  |_docs
  |_CLAUDE.md
  |_...
|_mobile
  |_docs
  |_CLAUDE.md
  |_...
|_infrastructure
  |_docs
  |_CLAUDE.md
  |_...
```

So, I'm working with all components in a single IDE window. All Claude Code agents/commands/skills are located in .claude directory in the root.

`monorepo/docs` and `monorepo/CLAUDE.md` contain documents that are applicable to the whole project. And each component also has a set of documentation specific to it.
