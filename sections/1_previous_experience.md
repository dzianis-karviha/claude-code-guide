## 1. Before Claude Code

Like most software developers today, I've been using GitHub Copilot as an intelligent autocomplete tool. And Claude Code wasn't my first attempt to delegate complete tasks to an LLM.

In early 2025, I tried to adopt Cursor IDE (https://cursor.com/) for my workflow. It's built on top of VS Code. The disadvantage of working in an unfamiliar IDE outweighed all the benefits I gained from Cursor. I'm a big fan of JetBrains products and have been using IntelliJ IDEA for a decade. I tried using both IDEs—IntelliJ IDEA for regular work and Cursor for delegating tasks to the LLM—but this approach led to constant context switching and loss of focus. Eventually, I stopped using Cursor entirely.

Then I discovered Claude Code. This tool has a completely different design. Instead of providing a full IDE, it's a terminal-based CLI tool with a thin integration layer for your existing IDE. This allows you to integrate LLM assistance without changing your development environment. Such a simple setup provides huge opportunities for customization and fits various workflows.
