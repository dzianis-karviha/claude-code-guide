## 11. What's next?

Claude Code may be used in numerous scenarios for optimizing development workflows.

### Requirements gathering

Requirements often arrive lacking technical detail. Claude Code can help structure this process by asking clarification questions upfront, preparing requirements in a standardized format, and suggesting implementation options.

This reduces back-and-forth communication and speeds up development — requirements arrive ready for implementation planning.

### Automate simple updates implementation via CI

This would let me implement and deploy small, straightforward updates directly from the task manager through a CI pipeline — no manual coding required.

The implementation path is clear but requires CI/CD pipeline improvements and dedicated time.

### Custom Tools for development workflow

I believe the current performance boost will plateau soon. While the workflow is efficient, jumping between terminal tabs, markdown files, and source code affects focus significantly.  

The idea is to build a dashboard that visualizes task input (to-do files) and orchestrates Claude Code instances.

This is still exploratory — I'll explore existing tooling first. If you've built something similar, I'd be interested to hear about your approach.
